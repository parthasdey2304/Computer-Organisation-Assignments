### 1. **Introduction**
   - **What is a Circle?**
     - Definition: A circle is a set of all points in a plane that are equidistant from a given point called the center.
     - Properties: Radius, diameter, circumference, and area.
   - **What is a Semicircle?**
     - Definition: A semicircle is half of a circle, formed by any diameter.
     - Importance: The relationship between angles and semicircles is a key concept in geometry, particularly the idea that an angle inscribed in a semicircle is always a right angle (90 degrees), known as Thales' Theorem.

### 2. **Materials Required**
   - Marble paper or any stiff paper
   - Compass
   - Ruler
   - Pencil
   - Protractor (for verification)

### 3. **Procedure**
   - **Step 1: Drawing and Cutting the Circle**
     - Use a compass to draw a circle on the marble paper.
     - Carefully cut out the circle using scissors.
   - **Step 2: Folding the Circle**
     - Fold the circle in half to create a diameter. This fold will divide the circle into two equal semicircles but do not cut the circle.
     - Unfold the circle and then fold it in half again, but this time along a different diameter perpendicular to the first one. This creates another fold line.
     - Unfold the circle. You should now have two intersecting fold lines that divide the circle into four equal parts.
   - **Step 3: Marking the Folds**
     - Use a pencil to clearly mark the fold lines on the circle.
     - The intersection of these fold lines is the center of the circle.
     - Identify the point where the two fold lines meet on the circumference. This point, along with the endpoints of the diameter, will form a triangle.
     - Draw lines connecting this point to the endpoints of the diameter. This triangle should have one angle at the intersection of the fold lines.

### 4. **Verification**
   - **Using a Protractor**
     - Place the protractor at the vertex where the fold lines meet on the circumference.
     - Measure the angle at this point. It should measure exactly 90 degrees, confirming that the angle formed by this procedure is a right angle.

### 5. **Conclusion**
   - Summarize the findings, highlighting that the angle formed by folding a circle and marking the folds is a right angle, confirming Thales' Theorem.
   - Discuss the importance of this geometric property and its implications in broader mathematical contexts.

This structure should effectively demonstrate the concept without cutting the circle, focusing on the folding technique to verify the right angle in the semicircle.
