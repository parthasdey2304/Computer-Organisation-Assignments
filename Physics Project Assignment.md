## Physics Project: Analysis of the Boiling Process of Water and the Effect of Impurities on Boiling Point

### Introduction
The boiling process of water is a fundamental concept in thermodynamics, crucial for understanding various natural and industrial processes. Boiling occurs when a liquid changes to vapor at a specific temperature and pressure. This project explores the boiling point of pure water and how it changes when different impurities are added. Additionally, it delves into the anomalous expansion of water, a unique property with significant environmental implications.

### Anomalous Expansion of Water
Water exhibits a unique behavior where it expands upon cooling below 4°C until it freezes at 0°C. This anomalous expansion is due to the hydrogen bonding in water molecules, which causes the formation of an open hexagonal structure in ice, making ice less dense than liquid water.

### Conclusion
This project has analyzed the boiling process of water and demonstrated how the addition of impurities such as salt and sugar affects the boiling point. The data clearly show that impurities elevate the boiling point due to the colligative properties of solutions. Additionally, the anomalous expansion of water, a phenomenon where water expands upon freezing, was explored, highlighting its importance in natural ecosystems. Understanding these concepts is essential in both scientific research and practical applications, from cooking to industrial processes.
